# API Status Report - 2025-09-09

## Summary
Successfully resolved all API connection errors that were occurring in the Flutter web application.

## Problem
The Flutter web application was experiencing connection refused errors (`net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`) for all API endpoints:
- `/api/v1/auth/profile-enhanced`
- `/api/v1/auth/profile`
- `/api/v1/ledgers/current`
- And other endpoints

## Root Cause
The API service was not running on port 8012, causing all connection attempts to fail.

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Applied missing database migrations for multi-currency support:
- Created currency tables and columns
- Added user currency settings tables
- Added exchange rate tables
- Created crypto price cache tables
- Fixed missing columns (`name_zh`, `is_crypto`, `base_currency`, etc.)
- Added required unique constraints

### 2. Service Startup
Successfully started the full API service using the pre-compiled binary:
```bash
./target/release/jive-api
```

### 3. Service Verification
All services are now running and healthy:

| Service | Status | Port | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| API Server | ✅ Running | 8012 | Full API with all features |
| PostgreSQL | ✅ Connected | 5433 | Docker container |
| Redis | ✅ Connected | 6380 | Docker container |
| Flutter Web | ✅ Running | 3021 | Web development server |

### 4. Health Check Results
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "features": {
    "auth": true,
    "database": true,
    "ledgers": true,
    "redis": true,
    "websocket": true
  }
}
```

## Available Endpoints
The API now provides all expected endpoints:
- `/api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/v1/accounts` - Account management
- `/api/v1/transactions` - Transaction management
- `/api/v1/ledgers` - Ledger management
- `/api/v1/templates` - Category templates
- `/api/v1/payees` - Payee management
- `/api/v1/rules` - Rule engine
- `/ws` - WebSocket connection

## Current Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - All API connection errors have been fixed. The services are running properly and responding to requests.

## Notes for Future
- The compilation issues in the source code still need to be addressed for development builds
- Use the pre-compiled binary `./target/release/jive-api` for now
- Database migrations should be included in the standard deployment process
